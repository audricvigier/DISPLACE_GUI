Formats of input files
======================

/graphsspe/coord*.dat

This text files contains the coordinates of all nodes in the dataset.
The dataset size is specified in config.dat file (see) as the number of nodes.
The data is arranged this way:

- nrow lines containing a float representing the longitude (X) of nodes
- nrow lines containing a float representing the latitude (Y) of nodes
- nrow lines containing an integer value representing the harbour field of the node

So information for the i-th node can be located at line i, i+nrow and i+2*nrow

/graphsspe/graph*.dat

This text files contains the connection information of the graph.
The dataset size is specified in config.dat file (see) as the number of edges (nrow_graph)
The data is arranged this way:

- nrow lines containing an integer representing the starting node of an edge
- nrow lines containing an integer representing the arrival node of an edge
- nrow lines containing a float representing the weight/cost of an edge

So information for the i-th edge can be located at line i, i+nrow and i+2*nrow
