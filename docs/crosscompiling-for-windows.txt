Cross-compiling from Linux to Windows
=====================================

Another option for building is to cross-compile the application from linux.
The advantage is that linux is definitely faster on compiling and building, and you can test and play with configurations quite easier.
The cons, are that building the cross-compilation environment isn't easy (but building on mingw is tricky as well), and you may need a windows environment to build the installer package using innosetup.

= Preparing the cross-compilation environment

You'll use mxe ( http://mxe.cc/ ) to build the cross-compilation environment, with some change and hack to make it work.
Since displace depends on QMapControl and other local libraries, and both QMapControl and displace depends on GDAL, it is required to build gdal as dynamic libraries.
Unfortunately, at this time, the stable branch of mxe doesn't support dynamic libraries, so you MUST use the development branch.

From the linux shell, clone the project repository and checkout the master branch.

$ git clone -b master https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git

then edit the settings.mk file and specify our target, that is, add / change 

MXE_TARGETS=x86_64-w64-mingw32.shared

If you want to cross compile for i686, use i686-w64-mingw32.shared

then apply the following patch to qtbase.mk

...


then start compilation:

$ make gcc geos gdal qt5base
