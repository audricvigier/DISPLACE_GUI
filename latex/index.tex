D\+I\+S\+P\+L\+A\+CE is a dynamic, individual-\/based model for spatial fishing planning and effort displacement integrating underlying fish population models. The D\+I\+S\+P\+L\+A\+CE project develops and provides a platform primarily for research purposes to transform the fishermen detailed knowledge into models, evaluation tools, and methods that can provide the fisheries with research and advice. By conducting a ecological and socio-\/economic impact assessment the model intends to serve as an aid to decision-\/making for (fishery) managers. An impact assessment will help answering on what are the impacts of the different policy options and who will be affected. By quantifying the effects the assessment will measure how the different options compare, for example how different the options perform in achieving the objective(s) of the policy.\hypertarget{index_Installation}{}\section{Installation}\label{index_Installation}
